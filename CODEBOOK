The project uses the following data sets: x_train.txt, y_train.txt, subject_train.txt, x_test.txt, y_test.txt and subject_test.txt.
The file features.txt contains the variable names for each column of x_train.txt and x_test.txt.
The file activity_labels contains the descriptive names for each for each activity in y_train.txt and y_test.txt.

The R Script run_analysis.R creates the Data_tidy.txt data set. This is an independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
